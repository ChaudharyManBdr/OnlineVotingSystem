                <p id="aboutUsText">
                    On-Line Voting System is a web based system that facilitates the running of elections online. 
                    This system has been proposed to simplify the process of organizing elections and make it convenient
                    for voters to vote remotely from their home computers. 
                    The word “vote” means to choose from a list to elect a candidate. The main goal of voting is to come up with leaders 
                    of the people’s choice. 
                    There are problems when it comes to voting. Some of the problems include vote 
                    counting which is time consuming, lots of vote are declared invalid, insecure or 
                    inaccessible polling stations, inadequate polling materials and large amount of budget wastage 
                    for managing all the polling stations. 
                    This ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM seeks to address the above issues.
                    With this system the citizen can cast vote from anywhere without wasting much time.
                    It is obvious that there will be drastic increase in number of voters since it will make easy to vote,
                    if it takes less than five minutes of their time. 
                    The purpose of this proposal is to implement online voting system as method for collecting public opinion.
                    “On-line Voting System” is an online voting technique. The person having citizenship of Nepal whose age is
                    above eighteen years can vote online without going to any physical polling station. 
                    In this system at first all the voters have to be registered with their personal details and their constituency for voting. 
                    Once a citizen is registered in voting list he/she will be provided unique voter-ID which will be 
                    required during the voting for security purpose. If invalid details are submitted during registration then the citizen will
                    not be registered in voting list. One person one vote will be strictly followed. </p>
